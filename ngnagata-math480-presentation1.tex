\section*{Outline}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Why a math major:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Liked math in high school, even during the calc situation, but assumed my only option would be to teach and I wasn't happy with that idea.
    \item became interested in physics, kept math on the back burner until freshman year happened (mildly traumatic $\epsilon$-$\delta$ proof and induction experiences)
    \item miscellaneous health/life events prolonged undergrad in physics, meanwhile became disillusioned with academia, got into coursera and edX and the current field of interdisciplinary math/sciences 
    % \item went from physics major taking lots of math classes, to math major took a lot of physics classes, meanwhile time spend "disillusioned" meant i was more comfortable with things I initially hated (induction, proofs, programming_
\end{itemize}

\item What I like about math:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PUZZLES (or is it...?)
    \item Actually, I do like puzzles. But to me it's the real world that's the puzzle.  Math is  the "tool" that helps me solve those puzzles.
    \item Applied math is my jam more than I realized it.  Physics is  a subset of something that is far larger and more fascinating to me.
    % \item BAYESIAN STATS BLOWS MY MIND    
\end{itemize}

\item What math is good for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item understanding and modeling the world
    \item DATA
    \item Even pure math has its parallels to the real world (hairy-ball theorem)
    % \item too many things...genomics, astrostats, MCMC, basically everything on fivethirtyeight.com
\end{itemize}
